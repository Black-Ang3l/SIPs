## Simple Summary

Deploy sUSD shorts onto L2.

## Abstract

Refactor and optimise the L1 shorting mechanism to be deployable on Optimism.

## Motivation

There is currently no plan to deploy iSynths onto L2. This means that L2 users will not be able to access inverse price exposure.

The shorting mechanism on L1 has around $50m of open interest on shorts. However, transactions are expensive, making the mechanism unviable for smaller trades.

Deploying this mechanism onto L2 will solve both of the above problems.

It will also enable new projects to be launched, demonstrating the power of composability on L2.

### Overview

The mechanism for shorting is described in [SIP 103](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-103). The majority of work in this SIP is around reducing code size to conform with OVM requirements.

It also proposes some improvements to the UX, namely:
1. Allow users to deposit collateral and increase their short in 1 transaction.
2. Allow users to repay their short and withdraw collateral in 1 transaction.


### Technical Specification

```solidity
function open(uint collateral, uint amount, bytes32 currency) external returns (uint id);

function close(uint id) external;

function depositAndDraw(uint id, uint drawAmout, uint depositAmount) external;

function repayAndWithdraw(uint id, uint repayAmount, uint withdrwaAmount) external

function liquidate(address borrower, uint id, uint amount) external;

```
