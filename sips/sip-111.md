<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to transition the Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) voting process from discord #governance-polls to the current Spartan Council voting process.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This proposal will enable proposed SIPs to be voted on by the Spartan Council. This SIP will transition the voting process from the #governance-polls channel to https://gov.synthetix.io and would mean that the voting power will be removed from the discord members who have been assigned a “poll” label to only those who own a Spartan Council NFT through the official Spartan Council Governance process.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

From [SIP-93](./sip-93.md) the Spartan Council was established, during this initial phase, they were proposed to vote only on low-level governance SCCP changes. At the time of this SIP proposal, the Spartan Council has successfully voted on more than 20 SCCPs and has shown positive engagement with the community and other stakeholders in debating and responding to issues that have arisen in the protocol.

As a result of this outcome, it is proposed that the Spartan Council should start voting on SIPs as the current SIP process is still carried out in a weaker version of governance within the #governance-poll discord channel which still possess many of the issues explored in SIP-93.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

If this SIP is implemented, all proposed SIPs will be created within the https://gov.synthetix.io IPFS snapshot space and governance discussions within the #council-chambers will include these SIPS. Voting on SIPs this way will help mitigate voter fatigue and apathy as the Spartan Council/

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Introducing SIPs to the existing Spartan Council voting system is the most low-friction option that can be proposed. Since we have the most evidence that this method is somewhat effective as it has been seen with the outcomes of SCCPs.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

All SIPs that are created on the SIP GitHub repo will need to be accompanied by a snapshot proposal on https://gov.synthetix.io/

If this SIP is successful, it will be the last SIP to be voted via the legacy discord governance system. This means that this SIP will still be voted on the #governance-poll discord channel.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
